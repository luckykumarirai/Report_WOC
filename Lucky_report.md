# Fireshort

##### This project has been created with the goal of providing a modern re-do of YOURLS and at the same time! A modern URL shortener built with React, Material UI  and Firebase. Authentication of this project has been taken from  [Firebase](https://github.com/chaseoc/firebase-login-page). This   project was bootstrapped with Create React App.To sum things up, this was a great full-stack project and I enjoyed working on it!


# About me

##### My Name is [Lucky kumari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luckykumarirai/). I am 3’rd year computer science  student  from [IIIT Manipur](http://www.iiitmanipur.ac.in/). The project was under the mentorship of  [Anubhav Singh](https://github.com/xprilion).

# Tasks done 

### `1.Add auto short code generator, rather than always entering custom URLs `
##### Whenever a new link needs to be created, a custom URL has to be added which is not ideal. So it should be like  whenever  we do not want to type  a custom URL it auto-generates a non-colliding 10 characters code as a custom url be generated.So finally we made both  functionality on card if we want to type our own custom URL  then we can whenever we do not want by clicking on the Generate button 10 length characters generated as customURL,and this works when editing the link also.

###### Link to commits -[Auto Generate custom URLs #9](https://github.com/xprilion/fireshort/pull/9)

# Enhancement

##### Apart from the above parts, I solved a few bugs here and there. the one bug I found most interesting and typical to solve was -
###### [#14 After clicking on the edit button custom URLs as well as Long URLs should be updateable](https://github.com/xprilion/fireshort/issues/14)

# Ongoing task

#### `1.After clicking on the edit button custom URLs as well as Long URLs should be updateable(no pull request  yet)`

##### I am currently working on an issue.This involves creating a function with functionality to  update URLs. 

# Future Scope

##### A lot of existing features use the benefit of real time and to make new features which take benefit of it.I would look forward to seeing the following in future -

 1. Improvement of UI on Home page.
 2. Show notification to the user when delete and edit existing URLs.
3. Short the arrangement of cards according to the date of  newly created.
4. Add Tags by which users can mark  favourite or important URLs.
